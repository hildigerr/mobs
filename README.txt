# [MOD] Simple Mobs [mobs] for MINETEST-C55 #

This mod, Forked from PilzAdam's [Simple Mobs](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?id=3063), adds some basic hostile and friendly mobs to the game. It includes additional mobs and rotton meat, which were originally provided in another mod called [my_mobs](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=4082). However my_mobs cages has not been included. 

Since the [original](https://github.com/PilzAdam/mobs) mod is no longer maintained and the author of my_mobs wished to continue it's development, the two have been merged.

Upstream contributions have been included from:

## ETHICAL DISCLOSURE ##

The sourcecode (by PilzAdam), models (by Pavel_S), and other graphics (unless otherwise noted) were originally released under the *WTFPL* (see below).

### Cow Assets ###
The cow texture was created by [rinoux](http://minetest.net/forum/profile.php?id=1128). It was retrieved from the [mobf](http://minetest.net/forum/viewtopic.php?id=629) mod by sapier. The cow's dry-up sound came from there too, which reports that the graphic is under WTFPL and the [sound](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mudchute_Park_and_Farm) was created by [Secretlondon](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Secretlondon).

### Rodent Assets ###
The rabbit and rat textures were acquired from cornernote's [critters](http://minetest.net/forum/viewtopic.php?id=3337) modpack. It's README.txt reports:

    Artist: Martin Berube (Available for custom work)
    Iconset Homepage: [http://www.graphics-and-desktop-icons.com/animal-icons.html](http://www.graphics-and-desktop-icons.com/animal-icons.html)
    License: Freeware
    Commercial usage: Allowed
    Readme file: textures/terms-of-use.txt -->[ I include it, but renamed to rabbit_terms-of-use.txt  ]

The current rat-in-cage image is also adapted from one of the critters from the same source as the rabbit.

## Sound Assets ##
The rest of the sounds were found at various locations that I don't recall, unless otherwise acknowledged in changes.txt. If you own one of them, I will remove it and delete all copies of it, at you're request.

## Other Assets ##
The unused images were created by me using [THE GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/)
