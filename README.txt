=== MOBS-MOD for MINETEST-C55 ===
by PilzAdam

Inroduction:
This mod adds some basic hostile and friendly mobs to the game.

This MOD includes additional mobs to extend upon PilzAdam's Simple Mobs.
<http://minetest.net/forum/viewtopic.php?id=3063>.
The additional mobs were originally provided in another mod called my_mobs.
<https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?pid=57041>.

It Includes:
		Animals:
			Cow (and milk),
			Rabbit
		Overcooking and using the result to make dye
		Meat spoilage if it remains uncooked

Raw meet can be preserved through "cheating" or using a refridgerator provided
 by VanessaE's Home Decor Mod <http://minetest.net/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2041>. 

KNOWN BUGS:
	If you drink milk from a stack of vessels, you will not recieve the empty vessel.

The cow texture was created by rinoux <http://minetest.net/forum/profile.php?id=1128>.
I retrieved it from the mobf mod by sapier. <http://minetest.net/forum/viewtopic.php?id=629>.
The cow's dry-up sound came from there too, which reports that the graphic is under WTFPL and
the sound is from <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mudchute_Park_and_Farm>
and created by Secretlondon <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Secretlondon>

The rabbit texture was acquired from cornernote's critters modpack.

The rest of the sounds were found at various locations that I don't recall,
unless otherwise acknowledged in changes.txt. If you own one of them, I will
remove it and delete all copies of it, at you're request.
